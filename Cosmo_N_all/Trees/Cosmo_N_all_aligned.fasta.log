Host:    Kathryns-MBP (AVX512, FMA3, 32 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s Cosmo_N_all/Alignment/Cosmo_N_all_aligned.fasta -B 1000
Seed:    280898 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon Mar  1 03:01:28 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file Cosmo_N_all/Alignment/Cosmo_N_all_aligned.fasta ... Fasta format detected
