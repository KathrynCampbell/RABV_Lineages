Host:    Kathryns-MBP (AVX512, FMA3, 32 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s Cosmo_N_sub/Alignment/Cosmo_N_sub_aligned.fasta -B 1000
Seed:    160658 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Mon Mar  1 02:49:05 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file Cosmo_N_sub/Alignment/Cosmo_N_sub_aligned.fasta ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 650 sequences with 1354 columns, 672 distinct patterns
